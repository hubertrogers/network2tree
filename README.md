==Visualizing a network topology as a tree==

Building on the existing d3.js collapsable tree layout examples:

* http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/tree.html
* tttp://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7880033

I added functions to take a network data set, and create a tree data structure on-the-fly.

Build using d3.js, with yeoman.
